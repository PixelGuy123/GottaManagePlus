# Gotta Manage Plus

### This project is currently under development. So anything claimed by this README are features yet to be added inside the tool.

**Gotta Manage Plus (GMP)** is an [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) project designed primarily to make the installation and management of mods for Baldi's Basics Plus an easier experience for the end user, while conveniently offering a cross-platform approach — for Windows, Linux and macOS — and a support for [GameBanana's](https://gamebanana.com) One-Click Installation feature.

Ah! By the way, if you're a truly Baldi's Basics player, then you surely must have guessed "Gotta Manage" is a sudden pastiche for Gotta Sweep. I hope I've been creative with this one. 😁

## Credits
- This Avalonia UI project heavily relied on its own [documentation](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/), which felt worth mentioning since this is my first time learning Avalonia and WPF in general, and on a very carefully [crafted tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrW43fNmjaQWwIdZxjZrx5FSXcNzaucOO&si=wE7Vq2U7puVkJcDU) made by the YouTuber [AngelSix](https://www.youtube.com/@AngelSix).
    Huge thanks to this guy! I wouldn't be able of doing much without his material.

- Of course, I didn't work alone while developing the whole app — except for the back-end part; a few beta testers, from my [community](https://discord.gg/GneZs7n2Gp), initially gave me feedback for the front-end content.

    The layout choices you see in this application were a result of this small group of people and, ultimately, of many vote pools, created by me, for the community to choose the most likable appearance inside the tool.
