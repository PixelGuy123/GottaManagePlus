# Gotta Manage Plus

**Gotta Manage Plus (GMP)** is an [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/) project designed primarily to make the installation and management of mods for Baldi's Basics Plus an easier experience for the end user, while conveniently offering a cross-platform approach — for Windows, Linux and MacOS — and a support for [GameBanana's](https://gamebanana.com) One-Click Installation feature.

Ah! By the way, if you're a truly Baldi's Basics player, then you surely must have guessed "Gotta Manage" is a sudden pastiche for Gotta Sweep. I hope I've been creative with this one. 😁
